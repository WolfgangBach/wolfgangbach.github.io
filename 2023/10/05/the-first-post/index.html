                <h2 id="exploring-johannesburg-a-memorable-adventure">Exploring Johannesburg: A Memorable Adventure</h2>
<p>Stepping foot in Johannesburg after a grueling 20-hour journey, I knew I was in for an exciting and challenging experience. My first task was to secure a reliable internet connection at the airport, enabling me to book an Uber or Bolt ride to my hostel. Although it took more than an hour to get the Wi-Fi working, I finally succeeded. Little did I know that another hurdle awaited me just outside the secure area where families and friends typically gather. A group of individuals wearing yellow warning vests approached me, claiming I have to pay tax. Recognizing this common scam, I quickly dismissed them and continued on my way. Fortunately, a friendly Indian passenger I had met on the flight advised me to keep walking, and I followed his advice, grateful for his guidance.</p>
<h2 id="arrival-settling-into-johannesburg-2405">Arrival: Settling into Johannesburg (24.05)</h2>
<p>For the first five days, I made Curiocity Hostel my temporary home. Arriving at 10 AM, I felt a bit apprehensive about venturing out immediately, as I had heard that certain areas of the city posed risks for tourists. Instead, I opted to explore Fox Street, the street by the Hostel, walking up and down its vibrant paths while taking in the local ambiance. Although it wasn&rsquo;t the same as delving deep into the heart of a new city, a sense of restlessness grew within me, and I longed to break free from the confines of the hostel.</p>
<h2 id="day-two-discovering-soweto-2505">Day Two: Discovering Soweto (25.05)</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the next day promised a thrilling adventure as I had planned a free walking tour of Soweto through Guro Walks. Thabo, my tour guide and a resident of the town, provided a captivating journey through Soweto. We visited a museum about a big protest against racist school policies, experienced a South African group taxi, went to his home to see how people live and explored Mandela&rsquo;s house. After the tour ended finding Wi-Fi, proved to be a challenge. Consequently, I resorted to taking group taxis into the city. To go into the city (uptown) you put a index finger up, for going just a little part into downtown you&rsquo;re indexing the index finger to the street. The people I encountered in these taxis were very open and helpful. Although I was initially confused when they told me that I had to get off now as I still had a 30 minute walk to the hostel, but then realised that the group taxi was going in a different direction, I embraced the opportunity to explore the city on foot. Cautiously maneuvering through the streets, I encountered a kind local who helped me navigate my way back to the hostel. The experience left me with a sense of accomplishment and an appreciation for the warmth of the people I had encountered. In the evening, the hostel&rsquo;s bar became a gathering place for both locals and fellow travelers, where I met fascinating individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<h2 id="day-three-art-and-diversity-2605">Day Three: Art and Diversity (26.05)</h2>
<p>On the third day, I had initially planned to embark on a free street art walking tour in the city center. However, a tour guide informed me that a free art gallery walking tour in Rosebank, a more busy and structured district of Johannesburg, was available instead. While it wasn&rsquo;t what I had expected, I decided to seize the opportunity. As I explored Rosebank, a contrasting sense of safety and restricted openness permeated the area, differing from other parts of the city like Soweto. People were more busy and not so open. After the tour, I ventured to Sandown to visit the Nelson Mandela Statue. Although time was limited, as I had another free walking tour scheduled in the city center focusing on Newtown, an area known for its multicultural community, I managed to squeeze in a glimpse of the statue. In the evening, I found myself conversing with a German traveler and a group of American students, forming connections and exchanging stories.</p>

<h2 id="day-four-adventure-continues-2705">Day Four: Adventure Continues (27.05)</h2>
<p>On this day, I eagerly attended the Saturday market called &ldquo;The Playground Market&rdquo; in Braamfontein, accompanied by the German traveler I had befriended at the hostel. Despite its small size, the market offered a delightful selection of fancy and mouthwatering foods, with table tennis providing some entertainment. Later, we met an old traveler at the market, who joined us on a visit to Constitution Hill, a significant historical site where both Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi were imprisoned. Fascinated by that place, time flew by. In the evening, I unexpectedly met Ines from France and Andrea from Switzerland, two adventurous souls in search of a fourth companion for their trip to Kruger National Park in the southern part of South Africa. Captivated by their plan, I decided to alter my original itinerary, bidding farewell to my intended bus journey and night train to Victoria Falls.</p>

<h2 id="an-extra-day-in-johannesburg-2805">An Extra Day in Johannesburg (28.05)</h2>
<p>This day was dedicated to organizing the logistics of my new travel plans. Researching the details of visiting Kruger and Victoria Falls consumed the majority of my time. In the afternoon, accompanied by the German traveler, I visited the Apartheid Museum. Though time constraints limited our visit, I cherished the opportunity to immerse myself in South Africa&rsquo;s history. In the evening I met Juan from columbia, he was the third person who will be with as on the Kruger trip.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="journeying-to-kruger-national-park-2905">Journeying to Kruger National Park (29.05)</h2>
<p>At the crack of dawn, we embarked on our journey to Kruger National Park. However, a communication mishap resulted in the need for two cars instead of one. Rushing to collect the second car, we found ourselves racing against time to reach the park&rsquo;s entrance before the 5:30 PM closing time (nighttime driving is prohibited in the park). The route treated us to breathtaking panoramas reminiscent of the landscapes I had encountered in New Zealand. Yet, one particular section of the road posed a nerve-wracking challenge with deep potholes. Arriving at the gate 15-minute after closing it, we were relieved when the staff granted us entry. Our elation, however, was short-lived when we discovered that at the Tamboti Tented Campsite the facilities lacked cooking supplies. With only pasta, rice, and sandwich ingredients at our disposal, we improvised a meal, laughing off the frustrations of the situation. The night was filled with laugh, making it a memorable evening.</p>
