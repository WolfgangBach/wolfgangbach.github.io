      <description>Exploring Johannesburg: A Memorable Adventure Stepping foot in Johannesburg after a grueling 20-hour journey, I knew I was in for an exciting and challenging experience. My first task was to secure a reliable internet connection at the airport, enabling me to book an Uber or Bolt ride to my hostel. Although it took more than an hour to get the Wi-Fi working, I finally succeeded. Little did I know that another hurdle awaited me just outside the secure area where families and friends typically gather.</description>

      <description>Exploring the Wildlife in Kruger (30.05) Our journey began with Juan&amp;rsquo;s booking of an early morning driving tour with a knowledgeable guide for a mere $20. The irresistible deal prompted us to join him on this adventure. Riding in a classic safari jeep with seats in the back, we embarked on an exhilarating tour through Kruger National Park. The diverse wildlife we encountered left us in awe - graceful giraffes, majestic elephants, colorful birds, graceful antelopes, playful zebras, and even a few curious chickens.</description>

      <description>The first little post Welcome, dear reader! It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you here on my brand new webpage.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about me, please feel free to check out the About Me section.
I&amp;rsquo;m still new to building websites, so there maybe some issues here and there. This website was built using Hugo, which is a static webpage tool that heavily utilizes markdown.
That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, but if you need to contact me, the best way to reach me is through email.</description>

      <description>About Wow, a whole page about me ;D
Why this website? I always have the idea to start technical projects. Often these are not fully implemented or get stuck somewhere. I have tried to build and publish a website myself before. Now that I am going to make a trip to the south of Africa after my studies, I had the idea to create a website for family, friends and as an external effect, where I can share my trip.</description>
