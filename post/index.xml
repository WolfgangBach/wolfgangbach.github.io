      <description>Leaving South Africa (02.06) We woke up early and headed to the airport to catch a flight from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls Town. It was the smallest plane I had ever flown on for a city transfer. The airplane had just three seats in one row, with one seat on the left and two on the right side. We landed in Victoria Falls Town, Zimbabwe. Juan accompanied me to the border with Zambia since I had booked a bed in a hostel in Livingstone.</description>

      <description>Exploring Johannesburg: A Memorable Adventure Stepping foot in Johannesburg after a grueling 20-hour journey, I knew I was in for an exciting and challenging experience. My first task was to secure a reliable internet connection at the airport, enabling me to book an Uber or Bolt ride to my hostel. Although it took more than an hour to get the Wi-Fi working, I finally succeeded. Little did I know that another hurdle awaited me just outside the secure area where families and friends typically gather.</description>

      <description>Exploring the Wildlife in Kruger (30.05) Our journey began with Juan&amp;rsquo;s booking of an early morning driving tour with a knowledgeable guide for a mere $20. The irresistible deal prompted us to join him on this adventure. Riding in a classic safari jeep with seats in the back, we embarked on an exhilarating tour through Kruger National Park. The diverse wildlife we encountered left us in awe - graceful giraffes, majestic elephants, colorful birds, graceful antelopes, playful zebras, and even a few curious chickens.</description>
