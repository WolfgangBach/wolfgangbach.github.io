      <description>The first little post Welcome, dear reader! It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you here on my brand new webpage.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about me, please feel free to check out the About Me section.
I&amp;rsquo;m still new to building websites, so there may be some issues here and there. This website was built using Hugo, which is a static webpage tool that heavily utilizes markdown.
That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, but if you need to contact me, the best way to reach me is through email.</description>
