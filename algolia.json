The airport was an old smal building, and there were no planes present. Rozilia, Katie and me went through the necessary security checks and waited in the small waiting room. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed, so we spent quite a bit of time waiting. Eventually, we boarded a small airplane, similar in size to the one I took from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls town where one seat was on one side and two on the other side.","tags":["travel"],"title":"Namibia","type":"post","url":"/2023/06/17/simbawe-sambia-botswana/","weight":0,"wordcount":3542},{"author":null,"categories":["Southern Africa"],"content":null,"date":1688688000,"description":"","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1200,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688688000,"objectID":"fda145eba2050626d19a7dd9e84a37d5","permalink":"https://wolfgangbach.github.io/2023/06/17/simbawe-sambia-botswana/","publishdate":"2023-07-07T00:00:00Z","readingtime":6,"relpermalink":"/2023/06/17/simbawe-sambia-botswana/","section":"post","summary":"Leaving South Africa (02.06) We woke up early and headed to the airport to catch a flight from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls Town.
